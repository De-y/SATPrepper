    "answer": "40",
    "explanation": "To find the final price of the shirt, we first need to find the amount of the discount by multiplying the original price of the shirt by the discount. 50 * 0.20 = $10. Then, we subtract the amount of the discount from the original price to find the final price. 50 - 10 = $40.",
